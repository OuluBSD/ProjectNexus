# Nexus CLI v1.0.0-rc1 — Unified Control Surface for Autonomous Development

## Overview

The Nexus CLI v1.0.0-rc1 represents a significant milestone in our journey toward providing a unified command-line interface for autonomous development operations. This release candidate delivers a feature-complete command tree with full parity to the Web UI, comprehensive AI session capabilities, and robust observability tooling.

With RC1, we've achieved:
- **Feature completeness**: Complete command tree across all namespaces
- **Web UI parity**: All core functionality available via command line
- **Streaming observability**: Real-time insights via Unified Observability Layer (UOL)
- **AI Chat support**: Token-streaming sessions with multiple model providers
- **Configuration & auth**: Secure token management and system configuration
- **Packaging + binaries**: Cross-platform native binaries for all supported platforms

## Key Technical Components

### Unified Observability Layer (UOL)
The Unified Observability Layer provides a centralized mechanism for capturing, analyzing, and presenting real-time data from all CLI operations. Through its streaming architecture, UOL delivers immediate insights into agent behavior, API interactions, and system performance. This layer enables developers to monitor autonomous operations with the same depth of visibility as traditional applications.

### Session ABI
Our Application Binary Interface for AI sessions standardizes the interface between the CLI and multiple AI providers. This abstraction allows seamless switching between different models while maintaining consistent behavior for token streaming, error handling, and session state management. The Session ABI ensures that future AI provider integrations follow the same predictable patterns.

### Deterministic Parser + Grammar
The CLI employs a formally specified grammar with a deterministic parser that ensures predictable command interpretation across all platforms. This approach eliminates ambiguity in command syntax and provides reliable error messages. The grammar-driven approach also enables the generation of shell completions, man pages, and validation rules from the same source definition.

### Manifest + Parity Auditor
All CLI functionality is defined through formal manifests that serve as both documentation and implementation reference. The built-in parity auditor continuously validates that CLI behavior matches the Web UI functionality, ensuring consistent experience across both interfaces. This system automatically detects deviations and prevents regressions in feature completeness.

### Release Pipeline & RC1 Certification
The RC1 certification process includes automated validation of all core functionality against both manual test specifications and automated parity checks. This pipeline ensures that all binaries meet platform-specific requirements and that the feature set remains complete across all supported environments before release.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Linux/macOS)
To install the Nexus CLI quickly on Linux or macOS, use the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.nexus.example.com | bash
```

### Windows Installation
For Windows users, download the installer or use PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr https://get.nexus.example.com/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

### Manual Installation
All platform-specific binaries are included in the `/release/` directory of this repository:
- **Linux**: `nexus-linux-amd64`, `nexus-linux-arm64`
- **macOS**: `nexus-darwin-amd64`, `nexus-darwin-arm64`
- **Windows**: `nexus-windows-amd64.exe`

Download the appropriate binary, make it executable (on Unix), and place it in your PATH.

## Known Limitations

As a release candidate, Nexus CLI v1.0.0-rc1 has several known limitations that will be addressed in future releases:

- **Mock API Client**: Some advanced features still use mock API implementations instead of connecting to the actual backend services
- **No TUI Mode**: Text-based user interface mode is not yet implemented; command-line interaction is currently the only interface
- **Monorepo Tooling Issues**: Some integration issues exist with complex monorepo configurations that use multiple package managers
- **pkg/esbuild Variations**: Binary packaging shows slight variations across platforms due to different pkg/esbuild behaviors on different OS architectures
- **Performance in Large Projects**: Some operations may be slower than expected in very large codebases with thousands of files
- **Shell Compatibility**: While shell completions are generated, some exotic shell configurations may not work as expected

## What's Next for v1.0.0 GA

The path to General Availability includes several important enhancements:

- **Documentation auto-generation**: Automatic generation of comprehensive documentation based on the CLI's formal command manifests
- **API-backed live data**: Complete removal of mock implementations in favor of live backend API connections
- **Improved TUI mode**: Implementation of a full-featured text-based user interface for more interactive operations
- **Enhanced error handling**: More sophisticated error recovery and diagnostic capabilities
- **Plugin architecture**: A formal plugin system that will allow community contributions and custom extensions

These improvements will be implemented based on feedback from the RC1 release and will culminate in the v1.0.0 General Availability release.
