## Stability Guarantees

### Manifest Stability
The configuration manifest format is now stable with a well-defined schema and comprehensive validation. Existing configurations will continue to work across minor version updates, with deprecation notices provided well in advance of any major changes.

### ABI Stability
The Application Binary Interface for inter-component communication is now stable, ensuring consistent behavior across different deployment scenarios and integration points. This includes stable interfaces for plugins and extensions.

### Semantic Versioning
As of v1.0.0, Nexus CLI follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer) practices:
- MAJOR version increments for breaking changes
- MINOR version increments for new features (backward-compatible)
- PATCH version increments for bug fixes (backward-compatible)

### Parity Rules
All functionality available in the Web UI is available through the CLI, and vice versa. This parity is maintained across all releases and new features will be implemented simultaneously in both interfaces.

## Deprecations / Breaking Changes

Nexus CLI v1.0.0 establishes the baseline functionality and API contracts for the stable release. As this is the first stable version, there are no previous versions to consider for breaking changes. Going forward, any breaking changes will be introduced only in major version releases, with adequate deprecation notices in prior versions.

## Known Issues

- **Mock API Client Behavior**: The mock API client implementation may exhibit different behavior compared to the production API in certain edge cases. This primarily affects local development and testing scenarios.
- **ESM + pkg Occasional Build Variances**: Under certain network conditions or system configurations, the ESM packaging process combined with pkg may produce binaries with slight behavioral differences. These are being actively investigated and resolved.
- **No TUI Yet**: While the CLI provides comprehensive functionality, there is no Text User Interface (TUI) currently available. This has been reserved for future consideration based on user feedback and adoption patterns.

## Looking Forward: The v1.1 Roadmap

### Live API Integration
Immediate post-GA focus will be on enhancing the live API integration, providing more responsive and real-time data access for monitoring and management operations.

### Documentation Autogeneration
Implementation of automatic documentation generation that stays in sync with the evolving codebase, ensuring accurate and up-to-date API references and usage guides.

### Plugin Architecture (Stretch Goal)
Exploration of a comprehensive plugin architecture that would allow the community to extend CLI functionality with custom commands and integrations.

### TUI Exploration (Optional)
Based on community feedback and usage patterns, we may develop a full-featured Text User Interface as a companion to the command-line interface for users who prefer visual interaction.

## Closing Statement

The release of Nexus CLI v1.0.0 represents more than just a software milestone—it's a commitment to enabling truly autonomous development.
